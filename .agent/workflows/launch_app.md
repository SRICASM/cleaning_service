description: Launch the frontend and backend servers

1. Start the backend server
// turbo
```zsh
cd backend
python3 server.py
```

2. Start the frontend server (in a new terminal usually, but here we run in background or parallel if possible, or just sequentially for the agent to trigger)
// turbo
```zsh
cd frontend
npm start
```
